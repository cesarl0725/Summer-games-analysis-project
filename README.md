Passion Project
Tracking Olympic Medal Trends: A Historical Analysis of Summer Games
By: Cesar Laureiro


Introduction
The Olympic Games stand as a global phenomenon, drawing massive audiences and uniting athletes from virtually every nation in competition. With a legacy spanning over a century, the Summer Olympics present an extensive and nuanced dataset, a trove of patterns, trends, and compelling narratives waiting to be analyzed.


As I prepare to begin my studies in Information Systems at Florida International University, this project presents an opportunity to develop the technical and analytical competencies essential for future roles. Leveraging reliable Olympic data, I aim to examine how nations have performed over time, identify which sports consistently dominate the medal tables, and track shifts in participation across decades, alongside other questions.


The central objective of this analysis is to develop skills in data cleaning, visualization, and a foundational understanding of SQL through  Google Sheets, all while uncovering meaningful insights from the history of Olympic performance. By narrowing the focus to the Summer Games and tracing medal trends over the years, I hope to craft a data-driven narrative that is both informative and visually compelling.


Project objective 
* Which 10 countries have won the most medals overall? 
* How have medal counts changed over time for the top countries? 
* What’s the medal breakdown (Gold, Silver, Bronze) for the top 10 countries?


Data Source
* Dataset: Olympic Sports and Medals, 1896–2014

* Source: Kaggle - The Guardian Olympic Games Dataset

* The dataset includes athlete-level records from the Summer and Winter Games, but this project focuses solely on the Summer Games portion for simplicity and relevance. The data used extends from 1896 to 2012
